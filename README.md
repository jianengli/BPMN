## Background
A wedding planning company is a professional company which assists with the design, planning and management of a client's wedding. Wedding planning companies are getting popular right now because many young couples nowadays who work long hours have little spare time available for sourcing and managing wedding venues and wedding suppliers. And weddings are significant events in people's lives, so couples are often willing to spend considerable amount of money to ensure that their weddings are well-organized. 

In this project, BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) was used to support the both IT and business staff to manage the business process of the wedding planning company.
